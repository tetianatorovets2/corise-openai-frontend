We interview women from across the field to hear their perspectives on the past, the present and the future of data science. Welcome to the show. Hello and welcome to the Women in Data Science podcast. I'm your host, Margot Gerritsen. I'm really happy that you're joining the WITS podcast today. Come meet Tally Whitney, an incredibly accomplished woman in the tech industry. Tally is especially well known for 15 years as CEO of the Anita Borg Institute for Women in Technology, or Anita B. Anita Borg was a close friend of Tally's, and when Anita fell ill, Tally stepped in and made Anita B. into the world renowned organization focused on advancement for female technologists that it is today. Before running Anita B., Tally was a well known engineer, then leader and executive in software and product engineering. We geek out a little bit in our discussion on programming languages, and then we dive deep into organizations like Anita B. and WITS that aim to support and inspire women and help them overcome systemic barriers to entry and success in the tech industry. Enjoy. Tally, I'm just so happy that you can join us today in the Women in Data Science podcast. Thanks so much. Well, I'm really happy to be here, and I'm really looking forward to our conversation. Yeah, me too. Who knows where we'll end up. I want to start talking to you a bit about what you used to do, because I realized that you have a PhD in computer science, and on your website, I couldn't find what you actually did your PhD in, so I'm going to take you back. Tell us about that. I got a PhD in computer science from Caltech in 1986, and at the time, I was working heavily in the VLSI area. My PhD thesis advisor was a man named Carver Mead, and he and his partner, Lynn Conway, had created something called Lynn Conway to allow students from all over the world to be able to design simple designs, and that's what we were all about. What made you decide to do that? I know that you got a master's in CS as well. What enticed you into graduate degrees? I got my undergraduate degree in computer science from the University of Utah. In fact, I was just back a couple of weeks ago. They had a celebration of 50 years of the department. It was one of the earliest computer science departments, and they were famous at the time for graphics, and that's what we were celebrating, actually. IEEE just gave them a milestone designation, and so as an undergraduate, I encountered graphics. I wasn't so interested in graphics per se, although I learned a lot while I was an undergraduate, but I was captured by this idea of what computer aided design. At the time, I was thinking about it in terms of architecture, but I had a professor at the University of Utah, Rich Riesenfeld, who introduced me to a man named Ivan Sutherland, who had co-founded the department at Caltech, and I went there to study. The idea of being able to go to Caltech to work with Ivan captured my imagination, and it wasn't very far to go from CAD of any kind to VLSI, and so that's what I did. I can imagine how fantastic that was. I started my own study in computer science and applied mathematics in 1984, so a little bit later, and my first programming language was Pascal. I still remember, so I'm curious. What was your first language? Well, as an undergraduate, they taught us a lot of different languages, and Pascal was certainly one of them. I remember Snowball, which was a string language. At that time, I do think that C was probably the primary language that we used, but when I got to Caltech, I became very interested in object-oriented languages, and so we used something called Simula, which was one of the earliest languages that had a garbage collector as part of it. Then I wrote my work in a language called MainCell, which doesn't even exist anymore, but it was this idea of having an object-oriented language. I started programming in C++, and I never really looked back. Do you still program? I don't. I haven't programmed for a lot of years. The last time I programmed was the last startup I was at, a place called Malleable Technology, and I wrote the assembler for our processor. That was probably the last significant project I did. I play a bit at home, but that's about it. I don't program anymore. Do you? No. I think in the last 10 years or so, my students have programmed for me, so I started with Pascal and then I went to Fortran77 and then ultimately got into C++ because of object orientation. I never looked back because you can do functional programming, object orientation. I know, audience, we're geeking out here a little bit, but it's kind of fun to talk to someone who started around the same time as I. But now, of course, one of the things that happened for me, and I'm sure it was the same for you, is that programming languages come and go so fast and it is extremely difficult to stay on top. My students started programming in Python. It was Java for a while that was really popular amongst them. They do a lot in R. I do all my prototyping in MATLAB. And then the students really started doing Julia. But by the time that Python really came up, I decided that I wasn't even going to try anymore to stay on top of all these languages. And so I'm not programming much at all. I miss it though, because I think it's super fun to do so. Did you know early on when you were in high school or maybe even middle school before that you were going to go this route? I did not. Before we leave the language question, I do think that languages come and go. But one of the things that I found is that as you get to know one language, it was pretty easy to go to a different language. Now, some are more unrelated than others. Lisp is definitely a very different way of thinking than Pascal or C++ or any of the object oriented. But I do think it's easy once you know one to learn more. I had no exposure to computer sciences in high school. My story is a very common one for young girls even today where they have no exposure. Some do, but some don't. And it wasn't until my sophomore year where I was at my wit's end of trying to figure out what to study. And I took this interest test that compared your interest to other people's interests in programming came out on top. And so I took a programming course. It was a COBOL course. I was clueless enough to not realize that was a business language. Because they offered Fortran, which would have been a much better choice. But I fell in love. I mean, most people don't have that experience. But I took that class and I knew it was where I belonged from the first time. But I started late. And so I spent the next few years just trying to get enough of the classes to be able to graduate with computer science. What was it that made you fall in love? I think it was the logic. I remember taking discrete math and it was just the idea of the logical made such perfect sense to me. With programming, you could do almost anything, even at that time. And this idea to be able to program and that that result could have an impact on things that weren't in your hands, it just made such a huge difference to me and was very attractive. I share that with you. I fell in love with programming when I built my own first real small simulator of a natural process. And I realized that with coding tools, I could develop virtual laboratories. I could try to understand the physics better for myself. First I started for myself, but it was so exciting to say, hey, I can simulate a flow or another natural process and by doing so really understand the physics better. The physics come alive to me. I thought it was super, super exciting. For those of you who haven't experienced that, when you're writing a program and you're trying to solve this problem, it is so absorbing. I become completely captured with whatever I was working on at the time. It was very fulfilling. No question. I spent around 35 years teaching at universities and teaching a lot of coding classes. And I see a lot of people coming into coding classes with trepidation. They are afraid that may not have what it takes to become good programmers. In the beginning, when you first introduced it is for me, at least, and I think for a lot of the students, it was a little bit of a different way of thinking, a different way of approaching problems. And it takes a bit of time for many to get that way of thinking about a problem. How do you build these arguments? How do you design the code to really get on top of that? And then, of course, once you are on top of it, you can start playing. And the play phase is always this phase that people's eyes lit up. They get very excited. The next stage I see in this learning is that people start to realize that languages have much in common, that the syntax may change. The way that you design a program is very similar. Of course, the whole world opens to them. But that first stage where they have to switch to this other way of thinking that is a big deterrent for many, and I see certainly women, also men, really be hesitant to take that first step. What kind of advice would you have for listeners? Maybe they're in high school, they're listening to this podcast and say, I want to know how to code, but I find that switch really hard. And it's hard for me to believe that in a few months I will actually be able to get it. That's a very interesting question. I have a few answers. As you know, I work a lot with bringing more women into technology. And a lot of the social side of our life gives messages to young women, especially that you can't do this, you're not very good at coding. And so they have an internal barrier as to whether or not they can do it. Universities, their Intro to Computer Science class have dealt with this by separating the students to those with experience versus those that are new to it. Because the answer is you need to just try. My best friend from grammar school really believed she wasn't good at math. And there was just this message to her that she was not good at math. And she's now a nurse. She took math and she was good at it. But she had to get past those messages that I can't do this. I saw that candidly as an undergraduate. I saw that with hardware. I was afraid of the building of hardware in my classes. And so I didn't show up with my whole self to be able to really truly learn because I now know I could have learned that just as much as the programming. But I was more tentative in those days. I had that same experience with hardware, stayed away from it. That barrier that you mentioned, these voices in society, you know, sometimes they're subtle, sometimes they're not so subtle. I've seen it happen where young girls were taught by teachers or by mentors that they just wouldn't have what it takes. That is so prevalent that those voices are so hard to conquer. I always think there's two myths that get in the way. And I want to see if you agree. One is this myth. And I think it's been debunked many times, but so many students still believe in this. And that is this myth that you must have a really strong innate ability to have any success at all. You cannot do anything in this field unless you just have this natural talent. The second myth is that the people that have more of this innate ability tend to not look like women. I've certainly addressed this many times in my courses. It comes up all the time. And as a result of it, what I find very often with women and sometimes also with men is that if they reach the first hurdle, so they come to a class where it's just a little bit harder and they're pushed a bit more and they're stretched a bit more, they become uncomfortable. For a lot of them, it's a sign of, see, I don't have what it takes because if I did have that natural talent, this would be easy. And I would never have to really stretch myself. I would never have to be this uncomfortable in the classroom. And of course, that's not the case. We both know that no matter how good you are from the start, you will always hit those points where you just have to push through and you will make so many mistakes and you just have to be very patient. It's a huge problem. I think it's those two myths. We've been debunking this for 40 years. I thought that a lot of the messages that you're talking about, I heard because I joined the field a long time ago, but I have heard women talk about the fact that their counselors told them that girls were not good at math. In the last year, I've heard young women who were offered a job at a prestigious high tech company and their male colleagues are saying, well, you only got that because you're a girl. I heard that a few weeks ago. I'd love to say that this issue has changed, but it has not. There's some interesting work. While I was at the Anita Borg Institute, we work with UCLA, with Harvey Mudd College, and we were looking at introduction to computer science. One of the ways that they rolled out classes where they brought together the students that had no programming experience and then separated them from the people with lots of programming experience. They found that those two classes caught up with each other within a year. There's actually data that shows that that's not true, even though that myth still exists. We try to talk about biases. Everywhere you go, you hear about biases. But it's hard to break through those internal biases of, oh, well, girls aren't good at this, or if you are somebody who's black or brown, that you don't belong. Those are really just very difficult myths for people personally to break through, but also for the people around them. I'd love to see a day when they're gone and we just treat people as people. Me too. One of the things I've certainly learned over time too is that what you refer to also as the stereotype threat is just so much alive. Claude Steele wrote some interesting books about this. Have you read those? I have. In fact, I've heard him talk about it. Like you're saying, I'd love to say that it's behind us, but it's not. You made it almost your life's work to work on this, helping young girls, aspiring women, technologists find their way and overcome these often systemic barriers. As I said in the introduction, you were the executive director of Anita Borg, you co-founder of the Grace Hopper Celebration. You've done so much in this space. What made you ultimately choose to leave industry and work on Anita Borg full-time for so many years? When I graduated from Caltech, I had become very tired of being one of just a few women. When I arrived in Silicon Valley, I was very eager to hook up with other women who were working in technology. It was a driving force whereas my day job was working in the semiconductor industry. I really wanted to find friends. That's how I met Anita Borg. Anita Borg was a very close friend of mine. She and I, we would get together with a group of women. It was really the women's group out of Stanford at the time that provided most of my connections. I'm still in touch with many of them today, but Anita Borg was a special person for me. She at that point was engaged in a lot of national programs at NSF and a place called the Computing Research Association about national programs for bringing more women into undergraduate education. As a friend, we decided to do the Grace Hopper celebration to celebrate the women that at the time creating technology. I was working full-time. I worked for 20 years in the chip industry and a couple of startups and doing really work to change that industry. I loved it. I did love that work. On the sidelines, I was working with Anita on the Grace Hopper celebration. Sometimes big changes are out of your control and Anita was diagnosed with brain cancer that ultimately took her life. She had founded this nonprofit and it was not doing well. She was struggling with it and she was dying. I almost reluctantly stepped in to help. The board asked me to step in. I couldn't not do it, so I stepped in. And I loved the work. The 15 years that I was at Anita Borgen grew it to a large organization. We were making a difference in people's lives, in young women's lives, and it was very fulfilling. Like any startup, I didn't have a lot of time to be doing work outside of building this organization. It was a pivot. It was a conscious pivot, but it wasn't something I set out to do. It was opportunistic. The Women in Data Science podcast is produced by Women in Data Science Worldwide. This podcast is made possible thanks to our sponsors Gilead Sciences, Total Energies, Walmart Global Tech, and Wells Fargo. It's amazing to me looking at Anita Borgen to some extent. It's the same with WITS, when you realize that there is such a need for what you can provide in the community they want to build, and the growth becomes organic. That is incredibly uplifting, not just to the people in the organization, but also to the people leading the organization and running it. What you said really resonates with me. It's been amazing to see how the Anita Borgen organization really changed. I remember when it first started, and I remember what happened while you were leading it. Is it right now where you always dreamed it would be? What are your fondest hopes for Anita Borgen? It's fun to watch it continue to grow and evolve and change, but led by somebody else. That's very fulfilling to see that it still has a significant leadership role. I love the fact that it's become increasingly international. I feel like we do have a chance to make a difference for women all over the world. I love the fact that there's all these other organizations, including WITS, that is really focused on a more specific area. Often for women participating, finding other women that have common technical goals is really helpful and very rewarding. So I love that there's more of a proliferation of those organizations. The organization is doing really well. I am frustrated by the fact that we still struggle to have women in leadership roles in technology, creating the technology. You and I both know that there's massive technology innovation on the horizon. As we think about it, we really want to ensure that the best minds are part of that. With women not always participating in a significant way, I'm not sure that that's happening. I fear that as well. It's a big driver for women in data science. We feel this urgency. If you look at AI, for example, and everything that we've been hearing recently about chat GPT and other natural language processing applications, they're really changing the landscape and changing our society. When you look at that, it's 10% at best right now, female participation. Clearly that leads to all kinds of unintended consequences. They're not as unintended as I would like them to be, but consequences of just not thinking about women, not thinking about the larger context and the impact that decisions can make. I think diversity in general is not just gender diversity, but any other kind of diversity too can make a tremendous difference in the quality of the product that is designed, but also in the quality and the fairness of the questions posed. And ultimately addressed. And I share this feeling of urgency with you. And it's a big driver for us in which we want to get to have at least 30% representation, not 10 by 2030. So that's our campaign. And 30 because that's what we think is a critical threshold. When you get to 30%, a minority is no longer really seen or regarded as different. The treatment becomes different and the culture changes. As women in data science, you are aware it's not just about the women and also diversity on all different kinds of axes to make a difference, but it's also the data. We know that the data that's been used to create these AI models, it's not necessarily diverse thinking. And I think that that worries me too. I applaud you on your 30 by 30. I think that's great. It is good to think about. What surprises me in talking to people, how few are actually aware how low the participation percentages of women in this field. That's really not that well known. We can open up that discussion a little bit more. I've been in this field in STEM for about 40 years. And when I started, I was one of the few women, or very often the only, that probably was the same for you. But I thought when I was 18, so 40 years ago, that by the time I was old, that it would have changed. It hasn't. That has been frustrating for me. It must have been very frustrating for you. It is. And that's a very eloquent way of saying what I was talking about earlier is that we haven't seen the impact that I would love to see. Now here's what I also know is that there are some places that are doing really well. The undergraduate I mentioned, Harvey Mudd College, there are 50-50 men and women in their undergraduate computer science. I think that Stanford is actually pretty good, at least the last numbers that I saw. So universities vary widely and they really have a very different approach to being inclusive for their students. Same thing with companies. There are companies that have created an inclusive culture where there is an increasing number of women. It's not 50-50, but there are women in leadership. There are women around the table. And I do think that if you look around, you can find places like that. They don't tend to be the hardcore tech places, I will be candid. I think that it's harder to change when you're big. For whatever reason, the technology culture has solidified in a way that isn't necessarily welcoming. What do you think would be the best way to try to change that? There are many organizations working on this. And sometimes when I speak to younger women, they are very hopeful because they said, now we're finally addressing this. And I remind them that 40 years ago, we also had a lot of programs for women in tech. Now of course, it's easier to reach girls. There's more social media presence. But still, it's not shifting very fast. What are we missing? Is there something that you can put your finger on and say, this is what we're really missing? This is what we need to do more of? There's no silver bullet. But I do think that if you look across the pipeline, there are some effective ways to create change. I do think that for young girls having exposure to role models and being involved in some of these programs that they remain involved, at least through college, can be very rewarding because they develop their own network. I mentioned that a lot of undergraduate programs actually do have programs that are more inclusive. As a particular person, you really need to understand the school that you're going to and understand what their culture is like and how you will thrive. What I'm also particularly interested in is how organizations can create a more inclusive culture because, as you probably know, companies are throwing massive amounts of money at these programs. A set of programs is not going to create cultural change. And I'll just give you one particular example of that. It's nice to have programs, alliances where people get together. It's important to have community. But what you really want to look at is the advancement. How are you advancing people across the board into positions of leadership, power, authority? And are you taking into account the wide diversity of your workforce? If you really take that seriously, I do think that you can create change. I agree. That's all I can say here. I agree wholeheartedly. I hope that people are listening. Sometimes I think that we need to come up with a system that rewards them, companies that really do take this seriously. Like we have a LEED certification for buildings that are eco-friendly. We should have a 30 by 30 sticker that actually means something. I'm just dreaming now. The NEELA board actually still has the top companies for technical women. And they take a lot of data from companies and highlight the companies that are doing better. It's one program to be able to recognize some companies, but I think it's something that's important. And it was important to me when we created it. I think that would be great. We need to do this also for data science. There we go. That's what I meant. That's what we need for data science. We were talking about dreams earlier and there's always two questions that I like to ask my guests. So let me ask you those two and see where it goes. One is now that you're no longer running Anita Bork, you have your own consulting firm, you're doing all kinds of other things. I know you're many boards of organizations, but what gets you up in the morning now and what keeps you up at night? What gets me up in the morning is seeing the excitement and commitment for some of the women leaders that I have a chance to work with. There is nothing more fulfilling than being able to talk to somebody who is leading a nonprofit or who is an entrepreneur creating a new idea of a company and to be able to talk to them about what is possible. So being able to contribute to the next generation is so rewarding. Of all the things that I do right now, that's at the top of the list. What keeps me up at night? The lack of change. I feel like we've been beating this drum for so long and there's just a lot of people who don't understand how they're contributing to the view of what technology looks like or what a technologist looks like or what a data scientist looks like. I wish I could figure out how to break those barriers for all the individuals who are creating that future and that I could convince them to do it differently. Thanks for that. I should have asked the questions the other way around because we're almost at the end of our time and it's a bad idea to leave with what keeps you up at night. So let me ask you this question. We have a lot of listeners from all over the world. There's many different countries that listen to us, which is wonderful. And a lot of our audience are aspiring data scientists. What message do you have for them? Leave us with some good, healthy advice. One is the courage to take risks. I find that people need to be encouraged to really go for it. The second is to develop the confidence to understand that you have the confidence to deliver whatever idea that you're after. The third is communication. The most important part of getting your idea across is being able to communicate your ideas and the importance of the way that you make a difference. I also think that curiosity and creativity are important in creating a new future. I want you to be at the table creating a technology that's going to change our lives. That's what you should do. That's terrific. I thank you, Telle, for a lovely discussion. Really enjoyed my time with you. And I thank you, listener, for joining us at Women in Data Science podcast.
